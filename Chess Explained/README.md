### Short description:
The Chess Companion application provides users with the ability to engage in natural language conversations with an AI chess expert. This expert is proficient in solving and explaining optimal move sequences for various chess configurations entered by the user. Leveraging existing libraries like Stockfish, the application identifies and elucidates the most effective move sequences.

In addition to solving puzzles, the chess expert within the application is capable of explaining the rules of chess and introducing users to algebraic notation commonly used in chess. This feature ensures that users, regardless of their skill level, can gain a comprehensive understanding of the game.

When offering move suggestions, the application goes beyond providing mere moves by offering insightful explanations. Users receive detailed explanations such as "the probability of winning is 90%, making it the highest among available moves" or "this move is obligatory as the king is in check." These explanations may also incorporate insights related to the underlying principles of chess or the specific themes associated with the game.

Chess Companion aims to be a versatile tool for chess enthusiasts, providing not only move solutions but also fostering a deeper understanding of the game through informative and interactive dialogue with the AI expert. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, Chess Companion is designed to be your go-to companion in the fascinating world of chess.
